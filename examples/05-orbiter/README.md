# 05 - Orbiter (MRO)

A full-featured Mars orbiter mission model. Its orbital geometry is driven by real SPICE kernels for the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO); the subsystems (power, data, radar, imager, comms) are **representative, not flight-accurate**. This is the most complex example in the repository, integrating five subsystems with SPICE-based orbital geometry.

It **composes the shared building blocks** — `libraries/power`, `libraries/data`, and `libraries/geometry` — and layers mission-specific complexity on top: an equipment-level PEL, a radar instrument, and SPICE-driven orbital-event activities. Where [04-hopper](../04-hopper/) shows the clean composition *pattern* at small scale, the orbiter shows what a realistic model looks like at full scale.

Migrated from [aerie-orbiter-model](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie-orbiter-model).

## Subsystems

| Subsystem | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Geometry** | SPICE-based orbital mechanics — spacecraft position, eclipse detection, occultation events, orbit parameters |
| **Power** | 14-component PEL (ADCS, CDH, EPS, heaters, imager, radar, SSR, telecom TWTAs, etc.), solar array with geometry-driven power generation, dual CBE/MEV battery tracking |
| **Data** | Multi-bin onboard storage with priority-based playback, configurable bin count (default 20) |
| **Telecom** | A simple downlink-rate stub: a `Downlink` activity sets the playback data rate from a parameter. The full Friis link-budget model lives in `libraries/telecom` (experimental — not yet wired in here). |
| **Radar** | Radar instrument with observation modes (low/med/hi-res) and data collection |

Every activity is tagged with PlanDev's `@Subsystem(...)` annotation (geometry / power / data / telecom / radar), and the model declares them via `@WithSubsystem(...)` in `package-info.java`, so PlanDev can group activities by subsystem in the UI. The data activities carry their `@Subsystem("data")` tag in `libraries/data`; the rest are tagged on the orbiter's own activity classes.

## Activities

21 activity types across all subsystems:

- **Geometry spawners**: `AddApoapsis`, `AddPeriapsis`, `AddOccultations`, `AddSpacecraftEclipses` — spawn event markers from SPICE data
- **Geometry events**: `Apoapsis`, `Periapsis`, `EnterOccultation`, `ExitOccultation`, `SpacecraftEnterEclipse`, `SpacecraftExitEclipse`
- **Power**: `SolarArrayDeployment`
- **Data** (from `libraries/data`): `GenerateData`, `PlaybackData`, `DeleteData`, `ChangeDataGenerationRate`, `ReprioritizeData`
- **Telecom**: `Downlink`
- **Radar**: `Radar_On`, `Radar_Off`, `ChangeRadarDataMode`, `TakeRadarObservation`

## SPICE kernels

This model requires SPICE kernels for orbital geometry calculations. The kernels live at the top-level shared directory [`spice-kernels/`](../../spice-kernels/) (tracked via Git LFS, ~238 MB total) — shared with `libraries/geometry`'s tests.

The kernel directory is configurable via the `SPICE_DIRECTORY` environment variable (defaults to `spice-kernels`, resolved relative to the JVM's working directory).

> **Valid plan window: 2024-01-01 → 2024-05-06.** The MRO spacecraft ephemeris kernel (`mro_psp.bsp`, body `-74`) only covers this ~4-month interval; every other kernel spans decades, so this one is the limiting factor. Plans must stay inside this window — simulating outside it makes SPICE geometry lookups fail with insufficient-ephemeris errors. This is why the demo plans all start at `2024-01-02`. To plan in a different period, swap `mro_psp.bsp` for an MRO SPK covering your target dates (from the [NAIF MRO archive](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/pds/data/mro-m-spice-6-v1.0/mrosp_1000/data/spk/)), or point `spiceSpacecraftId` at a different spacecraft with its own SPK.

### Running local build & tests

Download the SPICE kernels through Git LFS, then build from the repository root:

```bash
git lfs pull
./gradlew build
```

The geometry test task automatically sets SPICE_DIRECTORY to the repository’s spice-kernels directory.

### Deploying to PlanDev (Docker)

PlanDev simulations execute inside Merlin workers. Scheduler workers also execute simulations when running 
scheduling goals, so every Merlin and Scheduler worker replica must have access to the kernels.

Set SPICE_KERNELS_PATH in your PlanDev deployment's .env file to the absolute path of **this repository’s** 
kernel directory:

```bash
SPICE_KERNELS_PATH=/absolute/path/to/plandev-examples/spice-kernels
```

Then add the following entries to every `plandev_merlin_worker_*` and `plandev_scheduler_worker_*` service in your 
`docker-compose` file:

```
environment:
  SPICE_DIRECTORY: /spice/kernels
volumes:
  - ${SPICE_KERNELS_PATH}:/spice/kernels:ro
```

Use an absolute path because relative bind-mount paths are resolved from the PlanDev Compose project, not this 
repository. After updating the Compose file, recreate the affected workers with `docker compose up -d`.

## Scheduling goals

9 procedural scheduling goals (in `scheduling/`), built as individual ShadowJar artifacts:

| Goal | What it does |
|---|---|
| `AddPeriapses` | SPICE: Computes periapsis events and creates Periapsis activities |
| `AddApoapses` | SPICE: Computes apoapsis events and creates Apoapsis activities |
| `AddOccultations` | SPICE: Computes occultation windows, creates EnterOccultation/ExitOccultation activities |
| `AddSpacecraftEclipses` | SPICE: Computes eclipse windows, creates EnterEclipse/ExitEclipse activities |
| `ScheduleRadarObservations` | Schedules radar observations across science orbits (50% low-res, 37.5% med-res, 12.5% hi-res) |
| `ScheduleDownlinks` | Schedules Downlink activities on designated downlink orbits, outside occultation windows |
| `SchedulePriorityActivities` | Priority-based scheduling with 7 activity priorities and altitude thresholds |
| `SchedulePriorityActivitiesAfterDownlink` | Battery-aware priority scheduling with two modes: RE-SIMULATION and VIRTUAL BATTERY |
| `ScheduleRadarWithStopConditions` | Simulate-then-verify with rollback: pre/post-checks on battery, data volume, and downlink conflicts |

## Constraint procedures

6 procedural constraints (in `constraints/`):

| Constraint | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `MinBatterySOC` | Battery SOC must stay above a configurable minimum |
| `NoDeleteWhileWriting` | DeleteData and GenerateData/ChangeRadarDataMode must not overlap |
| `DownlinkMinDuration` | Downlink activities must meet a minimum duration |
| `NoDownlinkDuringOccultations` | No Downlink activities during occultation windows |
| `ReprioritizeAfterDownlink` | ReprioritizeData must occur within a configurable time after each Downlink |
| `MinWarmupDuration` | Radar must warm up for a minimum time before data collection begins |

## Demo data

Sample plans, views, and external events are in `demo/`:

| Directory | Contents |
|---|---|
| `demo/plans/` | SimplePlan (12 activities), MarsSat Plan (full orbital), Constraint Violation Plan, Example_MarsSat_Plan |
| `demo/views/` | Timeline views: Bin Groups, MarsSat Overview, MarsSat Power |
| `demo/external-events/` | DSS-24 comm pass source and schema for external event scheduling |
| `demo/external-datasets/` | `sample_dataset.json` (3 profiles × 60k segments) for SimplePlan; regenerate with `generate_sample_dataset.py` |

## Build

```bash
# Mission model JAR
./gradlew :examples:05-orbiter:build

# Scheduling procedure JARs (requires compiling first)
./gradlew :examples:05-orbiter:scheduling:compileJava
./gradlew :examples:05-orbiter:scheduling:buildAllSchedulingProcedureJars

# Constraint procedure JARs
./gradlew :examples:05-orbiter:constraints:compileJava
./gradlew :examples:05-orbiter:constraints:buildAllConstraintProcedureJars
```

**Artifacts:**

- `build/libs/orbiter-example.jar` — the mission model. Upload to PlanDev **after mounting the
  SPICE kernels** (see [Deploying to PlanDev](#deploying-to-plandev-docker) above); without them
  the model fails at load time.
- `scheduling/build/libs/<GoalName>.jar` — nine scheduling goals, one JAR each.
- `constraints/build/libs/<ConstraintName>.jar` — six constraints, one JAR each.

Note that the procedure JARs need the two-step `compileJava` → `buildAll…ProcedureJars`
invocation shown above; `:build` alone does not produce them.

## Try it

The quickest end-to-end path, starting from **`demo/plans/SimplePlan.json`** — it is the
smallest plan here (12 activities) and the one the sample external dataset is sized for:

1. Mount the SPICE kernels and upload `orbiter-example.jar` as a mission model.
2. Import `demo/plans/SimplePlan.json` as a plan.
3. Load `demo/views/MarsSat_Overview_View.json` as a UI view.
4. **Simulate.** This alone exercises the SPICE-backed geometry: the orbital-event resources
   (apoapsis/periapsis, occultations, eclipses) come from kernel data loaded inside the model,
   so a successful simulation confirms the kernel mount is correct.
5. Upload and run the `AddApoapses`, `AddPeriapses`, `AddOccultations` and
   `AddSpacecraftEclipses` scheduling goals — each spawns marker activities at the geometric
   events it finds. Re-simulate to see them on the timeline.
6. Run `ScheduleDownlinks`, then `SchedulePriorityActivitiesAfterDownlink`, and simulate again.
   Switch to `MarsSat_Power_View.json` to watch battery SOC against the added load, and
   `Bin Groups View.json` to watch the data bins drain.
7. Upload the constraint JARs and run them. For guaranteed violations, use
   `demo/plans/Constraint Violation Plan.json` instead — it is built to trip them.

For the fuller picture, `demo/plans/MarsSat Plan.json` is the complete orbital scenario; it
takes noticeably longer to simulate.

## Tests

```bash
./gradlew :examples:05-orbiter:test
```

This example currently has **no tests of its own** — the command above passes trivially. SPICE
geometry is covered at the library level by
[`libraries/geometry`](../../libraries/geometry/)'s test suite, which exercises the calculators
directly. Kernel loading *inside a mission model*, and the orbiter's event-spawner activities,
are not currently covered by any automated test; step 4 above is the manual check.

## Configuration

The model exposes several configuration parameters when creating a plan:

- `spiceSpacecraftId` — NAIF spacecraft ID (default: -74, MRO)
- `powerConfig` — Battery capacity, solar array area, degradation factors
- `dataConfig` — Storage capacity, playback rate, number of bins
- `offPointAngle` — Worst-case off-Sun angle for power calculations (default: 70 degrees)
